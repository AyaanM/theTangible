            <p>The Invention of the printing press is one the most crucial inventions in human history, fundamentally changing the accessibility of knowledge and ability to spread ideas. Its leaps towards a globalized world were extraordinary and the extent of its effects are rivaled only by the invention of the internet. The printing press, however, also opened another pandora’s box. A  force very much prevalent in our modern world:</p>

            <h1>Initial Advertising</h1>
            <p>Despite many types of common advertisements today being fairly new, advertising itself has actually been around for thousands of years. Methods like trademarking were quite common in the ancient world as they would promote the work of a successful artist or craftsman; encouraging more people to pursue their services.</p>

            <!-- third paragraph -->
            <p>The impact of modern advertising though, likely had its roots in the invention of the printing press. As information began to be widely spread, attached to the back of the pages were advertisements commissioned by the publishers to support the production. This was the case in many newspapers chains like The United Kingdom’s first daily newspaper, “The Daily Courant.” It consisted of only one page of information with the backside commissioned by its publisher to local businesses that wanted to promote their businesses. This commissioning of the backside coupled with the intense popularity of newspapers led to the beginning of widespread advertisement. From there, advertising jumped from medium to medium until American agencies, specifically dedicated towards the creation of advertisements, began springing up in the mid 19th century. This transformed advertisements from print texts to glorifying products and appealing slogans as entire organizations were built to think of new ways to entice consumers to purchase products.</p>
            <!-- forth paragraph -->
            <p>Today, advertising is a global phenomenon controlled by not only transnational corporations but governments, nonprofits and all sorts of people around the globe. Whether it be close friends ranting on about the latest and greatest smartphone or scrolling past a sponsored celebrity, advertising is a constant force in the modern world that often acts without your knowledge.</p>

            <!-- 6 paragraph -->
            <h1 id='basics'>The Basics</h1>
            <p>Advertisement is most often thought of as paid mediums used to influence a demographic; common examples being posters, coupons, video advertisements etc. These, however, are just a small part of the true extent to which advertising is used. Advertising when boiled down in its most simple terms is the <b>collection of methods used to influence a certain body or group</b>.</p>
            <!-- 7 paragraph -->
            <p>It’s a lot broader than most people realize and that does complicate things. An important thing to note is that advertising is not to be confused with marketing. Marketing refers to the process behind the advertisement. Marketing is the research and evaluation of audiences before beginning advertisement. You can imagine it more as the thinking behind the means and the advertising is the means itself. Advertising is linked with marketing as marketing a product to somebody would encompass advertisement. Advertisement however is not marketing. It fits as a major component of marketing but under the broader “marketing” term. When considering an advertisement, realizing the marketing behind it is equally as important understanding the advertisement itself.</p>

            <p>Advertisement deals with two main parts:</p>
            <ol>
              <li> The Target</li>
              <li> The Information</li>
            </ol>
            <!-- 9 paragraph -->
            <p>The target is the specific demographic that an advertiser is hoping to influence and the information is what the advertiser uses in order to influence the target. Think of it as the WHO and the information as the WHAT.
            <span class='footnote'>1
              <span class='footnote-text'>Keep in mind that this “specific demographic” could be just the general populous as well.</span>
            </span>
            </p>
            <p class='text-center'>Who + What = Successful Advertisement</p>
            <!-- 10 paragraph -->
            <p>All advertisements require a target in order to be effective. The information in the advertisement itself will be based on the target. If the target is the general population, then the information presented in advertisements will have to shift in order to be able to engage as large as an audience it can. If the target is very specific, then having information very specific to that one group will enhance the effectiveness of the advertisement. It may be easier to think of WHO and WHAT as manipulated and responding variables if you’re a fan of the scientific process. Any change to the X (the Target) directly affects Y (the Information).</p>
            <!-- 11 paragraph -->
            <h1 id='target'>Target demographics</h1>
            <p>As we discussed earlier, the target is the independent variable in our advertisement equation. Any change to the target would directly affect the effectiveness of the information in the advertisement. As a result, it’s important to narrow down a target before delving into developing the advertisement itself.</p>
            <!-- 12 paragraph -->
            <p>Target demographics refers to the market segmentation of populations, breaking certain groups down by families, race, gender, religion, income, and other social distinctions. This may sound like a bit much for just an advertisement but businesses use data like this all the time in order to be more aware of who they want to advertise to. To visualize the effect of analyzing target demographics, imagine that your company makes high quality gaming headphones and you’re tasked with advertising your product. If you had spent time analyzing the demographics of your region, you’d be able to narrow down specific groups such as better off neighbourhoods, or areas with high local teen populations like high schools. By knowing who your advertisements are targeted towards, you can narrow down specific areas you want to advertise.</p>

            </div>
            <!-- 13 paragraph -->
            <p>The next step would be to develop methods of advertisement that appeal to your target demographics. If you’re handing out fliers to young teenagers, that may not be as effective as something like sending out coupons for your products to the area your target lives. Although this example is a bit far fetched from reality, the basic concept still holds. Through the knowledge of one’s target demographics, advertising can be crafted specifically to complement their intended consumers.</p>
            <!-- 14 paragraph -->
            <h1 id='ethos'>The Information: Ethos, Pathos, Logos</h1>
            <p>For the actual body of the advertisement, we’ll focus on the information presented rather than the medium. As mentioned before, the Information is the dependent variable in our advertisement equation. By knowing who we are targeting, we can build our advertisement in a way that would better engage who we want to advertise to.
              <span class='footnote'>2
                <span class='footnote-text'>The medium is the method of advertisement. e.g/ posters, video ads, billboards, radio ads, etc.</span>

            </p>
            <!-- 15 paragraph -->
            <p>When it comes to effective advertising there are three basic pillars of persuasion used in order to convince consumers to purchase a product or service. These are known as “Ethos, Pathos  and Logos.” </p>

            <!-- 16 paragraph -->
            <p><b>Ethos</b> is all about branding and building a sense of trust between consumers and corporations. It’s about the credibility and reliability of one’s business and/or product(s). Branding is extremely effective, especially when it comes to the targeting of general audiences. General consumers tend to be drawn to the most popular and well known brands rather than some obscure new company. When the latest iPhone comes out, the general population agrees that the iPhone will be a reliable product because this is Apple. Apple has built that sense of reliability and product performance, allowing them to draw in people in the market for a new smartphone. Apple uses Ethos to gain the trust of its audiences and uses that trust to mold the general audience's opinion on its products. Through Apple’s use of Ethos, people assume Apple’s products to be one of the best in the industry regardless of whether they’ve seen prior proof of its effectiveness simply because it’s 
            Apple
              <span class='footnote'>3
                <span class='footnote-text'>The idea of doing something “The Apple Way” is once again the use of branding. Doing something “The Apple Way” comes with positive connotations because Apple has earned that credibility.</span>
              </span>
            </p>
            <!-- 17 paragraph -->
            <p><b>Pathos</b> refers to emotions and how they can be used to influence your audience. Using pathos, audiences can be made to feel certain ways at certain times; Helping corporations to influence their decisions and their actions. Pathos is often used in films and literature and is used to make audiences more invested in different narratives and to educate them on different themes in life. Themes like family, loss, regret and even humor are all conveyed through the use of Pathos. Advertisements can use these very themes to push you to feel certain emotions and associate those feelings with certain products or services. A good example is how Coca Cola’s advertisements focus on connecting the feeling of joy and their soda. Many of their advertisements encourage positive emotions in viewers through stereotypically happy events like visiting the beach or partying. These advertisements then associate the source of the events’ positivity to the soda, thus unconsciously making viewers associate soda with happiness and joy.</p>
            <!-- 19 paragraph -->
            <p><b>Logos</b> refers to the actual numbers or actual facts that support something. It’s when statistics or scientific evidence is used. Logos is very much intertwined with Ethos as establishing credibility in an audience comes largely down to the proof you have to convince an audience. Logos sets up logical conclusions for audiences by being the citations or research behind a claim. A common example would be in academic papers or informative videos where the use of direct citations and studies to back up information is essential in proving the legitimacy of one’s claims.</p>
            <!-- 20 paragraph -->
            </p>In terms of the advertising sector, think about toothpaste advertisements and how they claim that 9/10 doctors recommend their brand. These corporations build Ethos (credibility) in the consumers by use of Logos (facts and statistics).</p>

            <!-- 21 paragraph -->
            <p>Perhaps in addition to this claim of logos, these corporations may also use images of smiling people with perfect teeth thereby using Pathos (emotions) to further the effectiveness of the advertisement. In this way, we see how any group can use all three major methods to create the most effective form of advertisement. By targeting emotions, building credibility and backing it all up with facts and statistics, you can create the most effective methods of influencing audiences. Combine that with a thorough understanding of who your target is and you have a very effective way to influence consumers.</p>
            <!-- 22 paragraph -->
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>Those were the major terms and concepts that one should be somewhat familiar with just to be more aware of how corporations can influence your actions. To summarize:</p>
            <!-- 23 paragraph -->
            <p>An advertisement is composed of two main parts; <b>The Target</b> and <b>The Information</b>.
            <p class='text-center'>Target + Information = Advertisement</p>
            <!-- 24 paragraph -->
            <p>The Target refers to who the advertisement is aimed towards and the Information refers to what the advertisement itself is.</p>
            <!-- 25 paragraph -->
            <p>The WHO in the advertisement directly affects WHAT is in the advertisement.</p>
            <ol>
              <ul>Ethos is the credibility of a group (branding)</ul>
              <ul>Pathos is use of emotions by the group</ul>
              <ul>Logos is the use of facts and statistics to prove the claims of a group</ul>
            </ol>
            <!-- 26 paragraph -->
            <p>Now that we’ve covered the basics of advertising, Congratulations! You are now aware of the basic methods that corporations around you use in order to influence their consumers. You’ve also learned how to use those methods to influence groups as well! Part 2 of this series can be found here.
