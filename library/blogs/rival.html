            <p>Star Wars. Terminator. We often associate Artificial Intelligence (AI) with fictional characters from all these movies. But what if AI is already on the horizon? The world is an ever changing place. 15 years ago the world was in the age of flip phones and people were just beginning to start using social media. It was a time of rapid change and humanity’s speed of innovation was unrivaled. Then came the iPhone revolution, in 10 years, we had small little touchscreen phones that were more powerful than the room-sized computers we used to send people to space. The speed of human innovation is at an all time high and we are standing on a tripwire. A tripwire that will change all life on Earth forever. Let’s talk about AI: The Revolution That’s Almost Upon Us.</p>
            <!-- second paragraph -->
            <p>Artificial intelligence is defined as, “the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages,” by the Oxford dictionary. Breaking this down into everyday terms, AI is our attempt at cloning our biological selves in a mechanical medium. It is important to note that AI is not a robot. A robot is the “biological counterpart” to our bodies. It is our minds that AI mimics not our bodies, making AI a form of intelligence rather than a being of any sort. We want to see our intelligence and our selves in a mechanical medium. This may sound like the talk of the far far future however the different types of AI have been around for quite some time. </p>
            <!-- third paragraph -->
            <p>When we say something like “early” AI we refer to well known things such as calculators or Google, Alexa or even Siri. All of these things are just simplified versions of AI that are programmed to do one specific task narrowed task at a level far greater than humans. These are known as ANI (Artificial narrow intelligence). An ANI can calculate a sum, get through a maze or play chess faster and better than any human. An ANI can only do a select thing that it has been programmed to do. It cannot perform any other task simply because it cannot comprehend anything but its one select focus. This is the lowest level of artificial intelligence as this system cannot learn to gain intelligence in different fields. This is the type of AI that is present in our world from the robots that build cars to the calculator you use. All of the systems that run those things are ANI as they can simply perform their one select task.</p>
            <!-- forth paragraph -->
            <p>An AGI (artificial general intelligence) is the next step in Artificial Intelligence. Here AI can perform tasks as proficient as the average human. This would include stuff that we have not yet replicated in an AI. Things such as consciousness, learning, and creative thinking. These things are much more difficult to replicate in an AI and are what we currency use as a basis for the type of AI we strive to create. Creating an AI system that is capable of AGI would be groundbreaking, allowing for almost sentient level AI. Achieving this opens up the possibility of AI advancing to the final step</p>
            <!-- fifth paragraph -->
            <p>The last form of AI, one we should all be aware of, is ASI (Artificial super intelligence). ASI is a system that is vastly more intelligent than humans in every field including abstract thinking, learning and critical thinking. Imagine an AI which can create, process and learn faster than you can think. The power of an ASI is what frightens most of the world’s experts. An AI programmed to teach itself to think and become more intelligent will grow at an exponential rate learning faster and faster until we cannot comprehend it’s intelligence. A bird may see houses and buildings and structures but it will never be able to understand that humans built those structures. Just like that, we will be the birds that live in the world of AI but AI will not be able to help us understand what is happening around us. No matter how hard an ASI tries, its basic processing and intelligence will be too fast and advanced for our biological brains to catch on. The scariest part is that if AI is getting smarter, exponentially, it will continue getting more and more unfathomably intelligent at an <b><i>exponential rate</i></b>. Scary stuff.</p>

            </div>
            <!-- sixth paragraph -->
            <p>The real problem is how fast AI is approaching us. According to a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/survey.pdf'>survey</a> done in 2013 on the likelihood of super intelligent AI appearing, participants were to imagine a world where human activity continued at its current pace and then asked to say which year they believed there was a 10% chance of an AGI, a 50% chance and a 90% chance. It’s important to note this survey was done on the world’s <b>most respected and well known</b> experts on the topic of AI. After the survey, the median results of each likelihood was presented. 2022 was the median year for a 10% chance that AGI will exist, 2040 was the median year for a 50% chance and 2075 was the median year for a 90% chance. This literally means that there is a 10% chance that there will be computer systems that could be as smart as you in all aspects of life in the next two years and a 90% that there will be one by the end of your lifetime.</p>
            <!-- seventh paragraph -->
            <p>To conclude, AI is coming and it’s coming <b>fast</b>. Faster than you and I can realize. We know that ANI is already here with AGI not too far off; The idea of almost sentient computer systems will be real. That might mean ASI will be achieved exponentially faster than AGI; Achieving AGI might take 50 years but ASI might be achieved in just 5 years. The future is uncertain but we should all be aware of AI: <b>Humanity’s Biggest Rival</b>.</p>
